Project Title: SQL-Based Data Analysis for Inventory Optimization and Storage Facility Closure.
# Objective
The project aimed to analyze inventory data from a relational database(MySQL) to optimize storage utilization and support decision-making for the closure of an underperforming storage facility. The business was looking to consolidate its inventory across fewer locations to reduce operational costs and improve efficiency.
# Data Source:
I worked with data from an inventory management system, which was stored in a SQL-based relational database. The key tables included:
1. products
2. warehouses
3. orderdetails
4. orders
